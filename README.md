## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

-Leant how to build using NextJs

- Understood the importance of proper file naming in nextjs
- learnt the importance of environment variables and why they should be inside a `.env.local` file as the offers protection to the api key

### Continued development

-Make the users see all the links shortened on browser refresh

- Create a nice signup and login page and add some authentication.

### Useful resources

- NextJs video by ByteGrad on Youtube, learnt the importance of using nextjs inbuilt Image component and the importance of keeping a component as a server component if possible
- Kevin Powell video on why use CSS Grid. Practiced the use of grids in layout so much. I now understand when to use grid and when to use Flexbox.
